# tipsy

The first version of a language-matching app (think Tinder for learning languages) that I built in JS. This was before we had learned Authorisation, so the user's ID is passed from page to page in the url instead. The user has a profile, selects their own language, views other peoples' profiles, and can "match" with them if they speak the same language.
