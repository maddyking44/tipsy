 <h3>Learnings from "Search Inside Yourself"</h3>
    <p>
  How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?
  I like the idea of inverting the 'hierarchy of happiness' triangle to put purpose at the top and pleasure at the bottom. I think being purpose-driven is as rewardgin as it is challenging, and I feel lucky to have all three types of happiness in my life.

  What are your core values?
Empathy
Kindness
Generosity
Boundaries
Balance
Independence

  What do you stand for?
If you have privilege, it's your job to help up those who don't.
Equality, equity and resistance against oppression
Community, family and love
Honesty, integrity, self-awareness and self-love.
