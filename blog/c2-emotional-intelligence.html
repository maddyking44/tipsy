 <h3>Learnings from "Search Inside Yourself"</h3>
  <p>
    What this chapter made me think about was the gendered skills that masculine and feminine people are socialised to have - about how 'emotional intelligence' has always been an attribute ascribed to women and that's why we find more women in the empathetic professions of nursing, elderly care and childcare. However, these are among our society's lowest paid and most undervalued professions. It strikes me that emotional intelligence in women has been historically undervalued, whereas some men at Google can put a title on it and suddenly it's all the rage. In saying that, I think it's very good that this idea has entered the framework of engineers of all genders and hope to see it spread even further in future.

    I like the stuff about affect labelling and high resolution perception. I would love to gain an increased awareness of emotions as they move through my body.

  <h3>Two minutes of mindfulness</h3>
    <p>I always enjoy a mindful moment. I found it levitated my evening.</p>
