 <h3>Learnings from "Search Inside Yourself"</h3>
    <p><strong>Do the mlitiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>
    <p>   LOVED this meditation, am going to employ int in my own practice.</p>
    <p><strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>
    <p>    Chose not to try this one.</p>
    <p><strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong></p>
    <p>    “Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness” are so important to us that the brain will receive them as rewards or threats.</p>
    <p>    The lack of clarity in Phase 0 has made me feel uncertained and therefore threatened. </p>
    <p>    It would be so good for you to just email us a course outline PDF that we can refer to when we get lost. I think it would help keep your thoughts in order too. There's definitely a sense that you've changed things and haven't corrected their downstream effects.</p>
    <p>    ie. taken out a certain exercise, but then in a later sprint you ask us to do that thing. But we haven't learned it.</p>
    <p>    A course outline that mapped out in steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sprint number</li>
    <li>Key takeaways from last sprint</li>
    <li>What we want from you</li>
    <li>Instructions:</li></ul>
<ol>
    <li>Start in this tool</li>
    <li>Run these commands</li>
    <li>Switch to this platform</li>
    <li>Run these commands</li>
    <li>Take notes (Have a section prompting them to record How to merge a branch in Github, Commands to remember in the Command line, etc.)</li>
    <li>Refer back to these previous sprints for more clues</li>
    <li>Figure the rest out</li>
    <li>Stretch goals</li>
</ol>
    <p>All in one big old fashioned PDF course directory. It sounds stupid but would give people unfamiliar with this methodology so much more confidence and security.
