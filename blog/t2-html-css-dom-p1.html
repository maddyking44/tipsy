  <h3>HTML, CSS and DOM</h3>
    <p>We're essentially building a webpage like a person. HTML is the bones. In your HTML you have to designate your head, body and foot(er), and the different images and words etc that you want in each section. You can then divide each section into further sections to designate more specific design features, like your ribs or your hips. All of these eventually make up the different parts that you see on a webpage.</p><br>
    <p>CSS is the decoration. Once you've got your bones mapped out with HTML, you use CSS to decorate the body. What weight, height, skin colour, eye colour? Or, for your webpage, what background colour, font, text size? You might want to keep some of these essential features the same throughout your site, but change the clothing or shirt colour - the font size or image placements - in specific webpages. So we keep all the decoration instructions in their own document, called CSS. This lets us apply the same style to most of the webpages of a site, and make specific stylistic changes where we want them.</p><br>
    <p>The subdivisions (divs) in the HTML allow us to get really minute and specific with these micro changes.</p><br>
    <p>The DOM is how the browser reads your HTML and CSS. You might see your friend's body and clothes one way, and then you go to take a photo of them and they look a bit different. It's sort of like that. The browser uses what we give it in HTML and CSS, and then aligns our instructions to its own rules, which dictate how the browser reads these instructions. Sort of like transforming a real person into the pixels of a jpeg to make that photo. It's pretty much producing the same thing, the same website, but really the browser is producing its own representation of your original HTML and CSS, based on its own set of rules for reading the instructions. The result is the photo, or the DOM - the browser's way of understanding your HTML and CSS.</p><br>
  <h3>Boxifying design</h3>
    <p>This means visually dividing a webpage into box-type sections, so you can do different things in different areas. This seems to be the easiest way of creating a layout, because you can join and seperate different parts based on these invisible boxes, and that allows you to do different things in different areas.</p>
  <h3>Box model</h3>
    <p>This is how content is positioned in HTML and CSS. Each box of content is invisibly surrounded by padding, a border and a margin. You can adjust the pixels of each to move and position the element of content. The padding surrounds the content inside the border, you can give the border a visible line in order to see the box, and the margin is outside the border, cushioning the element from other boxes.</p>
