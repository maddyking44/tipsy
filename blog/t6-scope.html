 <h3>What is Scope?</h3>
    <p>
        Scope is quite self evident in JavaScript but I think there's so much emphasis on it because it must operate differently in other languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scope refers to the environment in which your code-commands have an effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you're declaring a variable within the curly brackets { } of a function, that variable will only work or be effective within that function. If you try to call on it in a different function, the programme won't be able to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is called Local Scope. If you want a variable to be accessible by all your functions, you have to declare it outside of any one function's curly brackets. This is called global scope.
