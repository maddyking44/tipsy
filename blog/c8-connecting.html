 <h3>Learnings from "Search Inside Yourself"</h3>
    <p>
            I'm really just skimming the book at this point. It is so clearly written for male engineers with low level social skills that it feels a bit redundant for those of us socialised to have more enhanced empathetic, communicative and interpersonal abilities. 
    </p>
    <p>     When I read questions like "Have you tried the techniques for growing trust and sincerity?" I think 'I am already well-trusted and considered sincere' - sometimes detrimentally so. A female-oriented book might, for example, focus on how one maintains trust and sincerity without losing her boundaries and becoming vulnerable. How to establish sincerity whilst maintaining a sense of humour. Situations in which sincerity is an ineffective tool. 
    </p>
    <p> The redundancy of this text for me is further highlighted by the way the male author seems to use male pronouns for bosses and  colleagues, and throws in female pronouns in random places or in examples of suporvisors being stressed or "emotional". 
    </p>
    <p>        Yes this is all very useful content to read and to exist and I concur with most of it, but I feel like, for me, my time would be better used on adding JS to my personal website for fun, for example, rather than reading things that are as plain as day but also written for an audience that excludes me.
    </p>
    <p>     Perhaps we could offer a different text for those who consider themselves to have advanced empathetic and interpersonal abilities? I could write it :D
