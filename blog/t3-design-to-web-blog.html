 <h3>Responsive</h3>
  <p>
    A responsive site changes its layout to suit the size of a device. All sites should be clear and readable on a mobile as well as a big desktop - which sometimes means certain elements need to be resized, rearranged or removed completely.
  </p>
<h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h3>
  <p>
    I think good desiign these days starts with the mobile design first so the mobile design doesn't have to navigate lots of unneccesary CSS.
  </p>
<h3> Frameworks</h3>
  <p>
    Frameworks are out-of-the-boxs tools that do a lot of the ground work for you to make a nice design. If you fit in with their rules you can create beautiful looking pages using frameworks. Unfortunately I don't like fitting in with assigned rules. The big con for me was not being able to edit the skeleton CSS (as we were linking to an online stylesheet)so I had to continuously find workarounds to hack the trickier things I wanted, which in the end won't make for good code. This system today of having 3 stylesheets on top of each other seems complicated and breakable.
  </p>
<h3> Wireframes</h3>
  <p>
    Wireframes are very very simple layout-based pictures that help clients get an idea of what a designer is thinking; help designers figure out how their layout will work in code; and help developers code a design.

  <h3>Difficulties</h3>
    <p>
      I had difficulty aligning the image to center using CSS and just ended up using center tags in the html. I experimented alot with the utility classes to get the images to look how I wanted them to, but I still don't compeltely understand the difference between u-max-full-width and u-full-width, as both are set to 100% in the CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I put my 4 wireframes side by side they were too small, so I had to override the margins in the skeleton container, and set the with to 100% and the max-width to 95% to get them filling up as much of the space as I could. I added to the utility classes in my own CSS to rotate the images which were defaulting to vertical. I think I'll just always want to do things my own way more than just submitting to what a framework lets me do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd love to know if that flex-box stuff we learned last sprint is still useful, if it was trash, whether and why skeleton is better, whether we can use both at once in the same grid, etc. I just always want to know how to get elements to stack on a mobile screen. The flex-wrap property allowed for that. How is skeleton doing it? Is it the float-left property? I'm also interested in the skeleton media queries, like it sets parameters for devices larger than 400px but where's the original code for devices smaller than that, or how does the browser know how to interpret it for tiny screens.
