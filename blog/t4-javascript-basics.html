 <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML and CSS were memorising commands to make the computer do what I wanted - like using basic English to tell a dog to go outside. JavaScript felt more like an entirely new langauge, with whole new concepts that I hadn't formally conceived of in my mother tongue.

  <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h3>
    <p>
      Loops. When the floor is 10 dirty, until the floor is 0 clean, we will sweep the floor.
      var houseClean = [];
      for (var floorDirt = 10; floorDirt >0; floorDirt -= 1) {
        houseClean.push(floorDirt);
      }
    </p>
    <h3> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
    <p>
      Arrays are sets of data. You count arrays starting from 0. You can access data from arrays using this count. You can also change data in arrays and pop data in and out of arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects. You put properties into an object, or I guess you add propoerties to an object. You can change, add and delete properties. Then you access data by calling that property's name, and you can use dots and brackets to chain together properties in order to access nested properties.
    </p>
    <h3> Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
    <p>
      Functions do things like running methods. You name a function and then you can invoke a function to run again by calling its name. You can also use parameters in functions to hold space for information later on, and then you can pass information into the function in those placeholders. This is great as it means you can test a whole bunch of scenarios with the same function, by passing different arguments into the placeholders.
