 <h3>Culture</h3>
    <p> I had a pretty deep understanding of the EDA experience going in to Dev Academy, because I've been working for Dev Academy for a while.</p>
    <p> My impressions are that it is hard, stressful work that is ultimately very rewarding. I see people form strong bonds under pressure on the programme which is wonderful.</p>
    <p> I don't do stress anymore. I see myself engaging with the programme by working extremely hard and enjoying the work. I love learning.</p>
    <p> My expectations of EDA remain the same. I'm excited to engage with this culture - to push myself, to learn something way outside the realm that I'm used to, and to engage in the self care focus too. I'm excited to integrate more yoga and meditation into my routine. I think it will be important for me to remember my motivations, and why I want to do the course. That'll keep me enjoying it through the hard parts.</p>
    <p> I'm ready to sink my teeth in.</p>
