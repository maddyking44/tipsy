 <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
    <p>
      Once upon a time a nomad was traversing the cliffs of code when she was impeded by a simple problem: Counting the dots in the dot game.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve the problem I routinely explained my logic out loud, as though to a friend, while pacing around my apartment. I also ran the script in my browser and read the error messages in the inspector, which was very helpful as it told me which lines the problems sat on.I tried a bunch of different methods according to different logics I figured out in my head. I read back through old exercises and challenges and the reader info given to us. A lot of my problems were to do with making arrays so I googled to understand the proper syntax and understand arrays through different words. It took a long time but I was very proud when I solved the challenge, and learned a lot more about loops, arrays and javascript.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>.map()</li>
      <p>
        Maps a function onto every element in an array. So if your array called myArray contains [2, 3, 5], you can myArray.map(x => x * 2), this will times every element in the array by 2, giving you a result of [4, 6, 10].
      </p>
      <li>.filter()</li>
      <p>
        You can use .filter to filter out elements in an array that don't pass a test, i.e. in an array of words, ['tree', 'present', 'chicken', 'peace', 'pie'], you can words.filter out words with more than 4 letters, [tree, pie].
      </p>
      <li>.reduce()</li>
      <p>
        Reduces numbers in an array to a single number, i.e. by accumulating them and adding them together. So an array of digits [6, 5, 4] can digits.reduce to 15.
