 <h2>Learnings from "Search Inside Yourself"</h2>
    <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? </h3>
    <p>
      Conversation is better when both people are fully present.
    </p>
      <h3>How did the other person find it?</h3>
    <p>
      They found the looping strategy to be incredibly effective.
    </p>
  <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
    <p>
      I think I will use all of them.
    </p>
    <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>
        Reading about mindfulness seems counterintuitive, I think I would rather be doing a guided meditation.
