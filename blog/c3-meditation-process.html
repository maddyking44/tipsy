      What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
    </p>
    <p>
       What new things have you learnt about meditation?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been meditating since I was 9. I thought it was a good way to declutter the mind, relieve stress and give my brain a chance to relax and refocus on the body and the present moment.
   </p>
   <p>
     What new things have you learnt about meditation?
   </p>
   <p>
     I've learned Google's take on it and some of the science behind it.
   </p>
   <p>
     Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
  </p>
  <p>
    Many are techniques I adopt in my own practice.
  </p>
  <p>
   Any other musings?
  </p>
  <p>
